# Spotify Popularity Prediction

This project predicts Spotify song popularity using:
- SQLite database for structured data storage
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- K-Means clustering of audio features
- Random Forest regression for popularity prediction

This project is part of my CS210 course deliverables, with plans to extend it into an end-to-end data science + software engineering pipeline.

## Current Status
Checkpoint 1: Repository initialized and ready for development.

## Next Steps
- Load dataset and extract 100k-sample subset
- Set up ETL pipeline to populate SQLite database
