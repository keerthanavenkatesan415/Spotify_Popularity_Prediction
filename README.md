# Spotify Popularity Prediction

This project predicts Spotify song popularity using:
- SQLite database for structured data storage
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- K-Means clustering of audio features
- Random Forest regression for popularity prediction

This project is part of my CS210 course deliverables, with plans to extend it into an end-to-end data science + software engineering pipeline.
